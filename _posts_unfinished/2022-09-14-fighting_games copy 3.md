There is a large cast of characters to choose from in fighting games, all with unique moves and mechanics. This diversity leads to a more varied and exciting game experience, and it's much more interesting to have different characters that do different things with different strengths and weaknesses. However, with all these characters, each with their own movesets (and sometimes mechanics), it becomes a struggle to have a character that's fun to use while not completely dominates the rest...

Now, having strong characters isn't a bad thing, especially when there are *several* strong characters that *do different things.* However, having too few, or even just one incredibly strong character can alter the general competative experience of the game. For example, the strongest character in Super Smash Bros. Brawl was Meta Knight, from the Kirby franchise, and he dominated *by far*. With incredible speed, offensive capabilities, and hard to exploit weaknesses, he completely dominated all other characters on the roster. There were other strong characters that could perform well in tournaments, but because of how easily they were snuffed out by Meta Knight, they dropped significantly in rankings. The other common character picks at tournaments were usually influenced by how well they could deal with Meta Knight, like Falco, Ice Climbers, and Pikachu, but even then Meta Knight always had a major advantage. This character alone single-handedly defined the meta of the competative scene and infamously became known as the *best character in the whole series.*

Meta Knight is a great case study of how strong characters can affect a game. There might not be as big of a power gap between characters, but strong characters can have similar effects on the game.

In tournaments and higher-level play, stronger characters are a common pick by most top-level players, with less players picking lower ranking A Tier characters and rarer picks of lower tier characters from less players. There's an occasional surprise pick of lower tier characters that are especially good at answering certain situations, but lower tier characters are usually picked less in general. 

Of course, the fact that stronger characters are picked more is pretty obvious, but the
