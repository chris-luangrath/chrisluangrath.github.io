Another problem that fighting games have struggled with in the past is a lack of single-player content. The main emphasis of fighting games is usually about fighting versus another person in a competative setting, but it's also important for games to focus on content that can be enjoyed alone. A fighting game can be a lot of fun, but it can feel like only part of a game if it's missing single-player action. Whether it's competative players worn out from the grind of online looking for something else, or people who prefer to play by themselves, it's important for games to be able to accomodate for that.

Street Fighter 5 had a rocky release in February 2016 because of several problems like bad netcode/servers and lack of characters, but *especially* the lack of single player content. An arcade mode and a story weren't added to the game until July 2016, 5 months after the initial release! These problems caused the game to be a disappointment in the eyes of many consumers, and although Capcom was eventually able to deliver a quality product by adding the story mode and an arcade mode, the initial reaction of the game had lasting damage that lead to a following smaller than what could potentially have been.

Looking at the problems that Street Fighter 5 initially had is incredibly interesting in hindsight, especially because Street Fighter 6 is in development, and it looks like Capcom is determined to not repeat their mistakes. They've announced a Single-Player Campaign, where you plays as a customizable character and explore Metro City. They've also announced a mode called "Extreme Battle", a set of rotating game modes with wacky rulesets, like dealing with stage hazards or using a different win condition, perfect for casual enjoyment. Capcom has taken great strides to make Street Fighter 6 a complete product on release, and the content that they're developing for their fans seems incredibly promising.

Also the music is bangin, wowee
