# Fighting Games
But then, there is one genre of game that trumps all others in my book...

Fighting games are in a league of their own; there are so many aspects to them that I can't help but love. The energy they bring, the stories they tell (not just in-game, but through its competitors), the burning passion of its devoted fans, the legacies created by savants and villains, the mastery of the game, the mastery over others, the mastery over yourself... is beyond anything else I've ever seen. To say that they're incredible would be an understatement.

Easy to learn, hard to master
