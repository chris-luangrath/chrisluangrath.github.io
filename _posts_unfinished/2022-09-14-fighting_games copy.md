What makes fighting games so special? What makes them different from other games? Why do I like them more than other competative games, like shooters? First off, they're not the type of game where you complete objectives to directly progress (unless you're unlocking content by playing, but that's not *exactly* the core gameplay...), but you instead progress by getting better at the game. Your progression directly correlates to the skills you develop, the matchups you learn, and the habits you form. You don't *complete* the game, you grow and become a better player. I think I can best expound on this by going over the 3 Masteries (I came up with this, unless someone else on the internet said it first I guess...).

## Mastery of the Game
A firm understanding of the game is required to perform well. Of course, that goes without saying, but in what way do you need to understand the game? What comes to mind is mechanics and techniques that are available to you in the game. Knowing complex techniques like wave-dashing or V-Shifting, knowing button inputs for special moves, stuff like that. Sure, you might be able to 

## Mastery of Self
How is this different from Mastery of the Game? Well, you can understand something all you like, but if you're unable to personally execute any of the techniques or mechanics that you know of, then it's almost as if you don't even know them. Players spend countless hours labbing combos and practicing techniques, honing their execution to perfection. By playing or practicing enough, you develop muscle memory, allowing you to focus on other things when you're playing. 

I remember playing with/training my friend who wasn't very good at Smash Bros. Ultimate; it was especially difficult for him because he was using new controls and wasn't as familiar with the game as I was. Attacks were almost random, with no real gameplan involved, and jumping/recovering was laborious because he'd have to specifically remember/react to do it. After more playing, he improved tremendously! His attacks and approaches were much more calculated, he could make riskier plays because he understood the game better, jumping/recovering were basically second nature, and he could play with much more ease. 

This aspect is probably my favorite part of fighting games. After every match--wins, and *especially* losses--there is always something I can improve on. When I lose, there are usually several things that are extremely apparent to mke that I can do better. Maybe I dropped the game-winning combo, or was letting the other person jump at me for free because I never anti-aired... stuff like that. These mistakes make themselves extremly apparent to me, and I know that if I want to get better at the game, I know what I need to be better at.

## Mastery of Others
You don't just win games by executing combos or playing perfectly, you win games by *outplaying* your opponent. They too carry the burden of needing to play perfectly, and they share the same consequences for failing to do so. This either happens by capitalizing on mistakes that they make or predicting their actions and decisions. Blocking beats attacking, grabbing beats blocking, attacking beats grabbing (sometimes? unclear sometimes), and it's up to the players to respond to their opponent correctly. Whiffing attacks gives the other player the opportunity to exploit a brief window of weakness. Expecting the other player to jump in allows you to react faster with an anti-air. Knowing what your opponent is about to do before they do it is a huge advantage over the other player, and correctly exploiting it is a major key to winning.

## Intricacy
It's interesting, intricacy is one of the things that make fighting games great, but it's also something that makes it hard to approach. 

Easy to learn, hard to master
