In single-player games, this would include things like maintaining speed in movement-focused games or defeating a difficult boss. When you introduce actual players into the equation however, things start to get a bit more complicated. The goals of the two players are now opposing each other; you still... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>How Are Characters Balanced?</title><link href="https://chris-luangrath.github.io//posts/balance_moves/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How Are Characters Balanced?" /><published>2022-09-26T06:00:00-06:00</published> <updated>2022-09-26T06:00:00-06:00</updated> <id>https://chris-luangrath.github.io//posts/balance_moves/</id> <content src="https://chris-luangrath.github.io//posts/balance_moves/" /> <author> <name>Chris Luangrath</name> </author> <category term="balancing" /> <category term="characters" /> <summary> There is a large cast of characters to choose from in fighting games, all with unique moves and mechanics. This diversity leads to a more varied and exciting game experience, and it’s much more interesting to have different characters that do different things with different strengths and weaknesses. However, it’s a struggle to make characters that are fun to use that don’t also completely domi... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Problems With Fighting Games - Single Player Content</title><link href="https://chris-luangrath.github.io//posts/fighting_games-prob-2/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Problems With Fighting Games - Single Player Content" /><published>2022-09-17T06:00:00-06:00</published> <updated>2022-09-17T06:00:00-06:00</updated> <id>https://chris-luangrath.github.io//posts/fighting_games-prob-2/</id> <content src="https://chris-luangrath.github.io//posts/fighting_games-prob-2/" /> <author> <name>Chris Luangrath</name> </author> <category term="fighting games" /> <category term="problems" /> <summary> Another problem that fighting games have struggled with in the past is a lack of single-player content. The main emphasis of fighting games is usually about fighting versus another person in a competative setting, but it’s also important for games to focus on content that can be enjoyed alone. A fighting game can be a lot of fun, but it can feel like only part of a game if it’s missing single-p... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Problems With Fighting Games - Intricacy</title><link href="https://chris-luangrath.github.io//posts/fighting_games-prob-1/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Problems With Fighting Games - Intricacy" /><published>2022-09-16T08:00:00-06:00</published> <updated>2022-09-16T08:00:00-06:00</updated> <id>https://chris-luangrath.github.io//posts/fighting_games-prob-1/</id> <content src="https://chris-luangrath.github.io//posts/fighting_games-prob-1/" /> <author> <name>Chris Luangrath</name> </author> <category term="fighting games" /> <category term="problems" /> <summary> Earlier, I was talking about how fighting games are some of the coolest games out there. However, if that’s the case, why aren’t they more popular? Despite their appeal, fighting games as a genre have some hurdles that put them at a slight disadvantage compared to “normal” games. However, games today are doing better in making Intricacy Intricacy is something that many fighting game fans appre... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Mastering Fighting Games</title><link href="https://chris-luangrath.github.io//posts/fighting_games/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mastering Fighting Games" /><published>2022-09-14T20:30:00-06:00</published> <updated>2022-09-14T20:30:00-06:00</updated> <id>https://chris-luangrath.github.io//posts/fighting_games/</id> <content src="https://chris-luangrath.github.io//posts/fighting_games/" /> <author> <name>Chris Luangrath</name> </author> <category term="general" /> <category term="personal" /> <summary> What makes fighting games so special? What makes them different from other games? Why do I like them more than other competative games, like shooters? First off, they’re not the type of game where you complete objectives to directly progress (unless you’re unlocking content by playing, but that’s not exactly the core gameplay…), but you instead progress by getting better at the game.
