These are some projects that I've worked on (and finished!). As of now, both are projects that I've worked on for school,
but I hope to add projects that I've started on my own.

# Mecha Mantis

This is a portfolio piece that I submitted with my application into the animation emphasis program at BYU. 
The warehouse background texture, the metal texture on the blades and wings, and the floor texture are all not 
mine, but images that I found online. This was for the last project in CSANM 150, where our prompt 
was to design a bug. I decided to design a sort of praying mantis with with technological 'enhancements'. 

# Lego Battle

This was another submission with my application. This was the for the first project in CSANM 150, 
where our prompt was to make a lego person and put them in a scenario. I made this little skirmish
with these 3 people. I painted simple textures in Clip Studio Paint for the lego faces and clothes,
and the ground and backdrop textures were found online.
