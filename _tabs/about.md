![This is a picture from 2020. I do not take many pictures of myself...](../assets/me_wallpaper.jpg)

I am a 3rd year student at Brigham Young University. I am currently working towards a degree in 
Computer Science with an Emphasis in Animation. I currently work as a research assistant under Professor David Wingate 
in the Perception, Control, and Cognition Lab (PCCL). I am half Chinese and half Lao. 
I speak English, Thai, and Lao.
