![This is a picture from 2020. I do not take many pictures of myself...](../assets/me_wallpaper.jpg)

I am a 3rd year student at Brigham Young University. I am currently working towards a degree in 
Computer Science with an Emphasis in Animation. I currently work as a research assistant under Professor David Wingate 
in the Perception, Control, and Cognition Lab (PCCL). I am half Chinese and half Lao. 
I speak English, Thai, and Lao. 

# About This Website
This website is so you can learn who I am. The content showcased here will be school projects, personal projects, and 
random stuff about fighting games that I think about. Why am I posting about fighting games on a personal portfolio?
I am applying for an internship with Riot Games to work on Project L, and since it is literally the coolest project I
could possibly be working on in the near future, I want to do my best to show off that I know my way around fighting games
and that I'm qualified and a good candidate to work on theirs. Plus, I think about this stuff all the time, and it'll be a 
cool place to document it.
