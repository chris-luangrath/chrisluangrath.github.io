# About Me
![This is a picture from 2020. I do not take many pictures of myself...](../assets/me_wallpaper.jpg)

I am a 3rd year student at Brigham Young University. I am currently working towards a degree in 
computer science with an emphasis in animation. I currently work as a research assistant under Professor David Wingate 
in the Perception, Control, and Cognition Lab (PCCL). I am half Chinese and half Lao. 
I speak English, Thai, and Lao. 

# Fighting Games
Simply put, I love fighting games. I'll fill this out later, but for future reference
- Intense
- Meet new people
- Master yourself
- Super cool
- My dad grew up on Street Fighter 2
