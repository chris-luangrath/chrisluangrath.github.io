There is a large cast of characters to choose from in fighting games, all with unique moves and mechanics. This diversity leads to a more varied and exciting game experience, and it's much more interesting to have different characters that do different things with different strengths and weaknesses.

However, it's a struggle to make characters that are fun to use that don't also completely dominate the rest. Lots of consideration goes into the characters before the game is produced, but play-testing won't always reveal the flaws of a game, and through the cracks there'd slip something that influences a game, like Meta Knight in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. In the past, nothing could be done to fix stuff like this, and it'd have to be left in the game along with its consequences. However, in the modern age of video games and internet capabilities, it has become common practice to alter games over time in *patches*, allowing them to live and grow in a sense. In the context of competative games, it's now possible to stregthen weaker characters and make strong characters... not as strong.

Now remember: it's not *bad* that a character is good or bad at something. Characters are meant to do cool things in games, or else it's not fun to play. However, it becomes a problem if a character is good at too many things, especially things that are outside of their intended gameplay. Same goes for weaknesses a character may have; it's fine if they're weak at certain things, but it's bad if they're not even good at the things they're meant to be.


There are many different ways to alter a character, but let's focus on one method: 

# Balancing Movesets.
There are several major aspects that define a move: Range, Speed, Damage, and Cost
- The range of a move determines the max distance a character can be from the opponent and still hit them, basically allowing them to control or contest spacing. 
- The speed of a move determines its ability to punish slower moves that whiff or beat out slower moves that are thrown at the same time.
- The damage of a move determines how much closer you are to winning after you use this move. It doesn't have to be just this move, but also the combo potential from the move as well, as canceling into stronger moves or combos can lead to even more damage.
- The cost of a move can mean using resources, like meter or health, but it can also mean punishability, or makeing yourself vulnerable to an attack. Punishability is *kinda* like speed, but there's a lot that seperates them. For example, a move could be slow but have a large hurtbox or armor properties that make it hard to punish. Or, a move could be fast but have a lingering hitbox that is easy to take advantage of.
<!-- Maybe split this up into risk and reward, cost and punishability are pretty different actually -->

These attributes come together to balance the scales of risk and reward. If a move has too much risk or too little reward it's not even worth using, but too little risk and too much reward and there's no reason to not throw it out all the time. 

Let's look at an example:
In Street Fighter V, Cammy is a very strong character with fast moves that hit from far away. One of her moves, "Cannon Strike", was an aerial dive kick that could quickly hit from accross the screen and combo into other moves, including her high-damaging critical art, all while being extremely hard to punish or react to. The only cost would be that it required a full "V-Meter" which fills by getting hit and doing certain moves. So, looking at the previously mentioned aspects, Cannon Strike had excellent range, speed, and damage, all at a low cost. 

Their solution was to greatly increase the punish window of a whiffed Cannon Strike from 9 frames to a whopping 17 frames! The move is still incredibly strong, but now with a much higher cost or risk. This was a great fix, as they couldn't change other aspects of this move, like the speed or the ability to cancel into moves, without severely changing a part of Cammy's gameplay. Cammy would ultimately play the same, but now with more risk of using this strong move.

I can look at more examples in the future, especially an example of making a character better, but this is good for now. It's a great example of how to make a character more fair (and fun) to play against while not changing a core part of the character's gameplay. Thanks to balance patches, games can be a better time for everyone. I don't know how to end this. See ya.


<!-- There are usually different tiers to basic attacks in most fighting games, but let's use Street Fighter V as an example. SFV has Light, Medium, and Heavy attacks, and these generally have different attributes to define them.
- Light moves are fast, and generally safe on block and harder to react to. They sometimes can lead to combos, but these are usually lower-damaging combos. Great for chipping away health and poking the opponent's openings.
- Medium moves, can be plus but sometimes punishable, lead to heavier combos -->
