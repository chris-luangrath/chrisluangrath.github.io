# Welcome!

This website is so you can learn who I am. The content showcased here will be school projects, personal projects, and 
random stuff about fighting games that I think about. Why am I posting about fighting games on a website no one will read?
Because I am applying for an internship with Riot Games to work on Project L, and since it is literally the coolest project I
could possibly be working on in the near future, I want to do my best to show off that I know my way around fighting games
and that I'm qualified and a good candidate to work on theirs. Plus, I think about this stuff all the time, and it'll be a 
cool place to document it. *It's called playing to your audience, and I'm not afraid to do it*

This is just a little website to show off . It's not very flashy or technically advanced,
but its good enough for now for what I'm doing anyways, haha.
