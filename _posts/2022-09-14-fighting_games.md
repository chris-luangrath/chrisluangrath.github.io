# Why Do I Like Video Games?
I've been playing video games my whole life. As a small kid, I remember watching my dad play Robotech, 
or playing Lego Star Wars with my mom. I remember feeling extremely proud of myself after beating 
Pokemon Fire Red, playing Super Smash Bros. with my friends, and so many other things. Video Games 
have lead me to meet some of my closest friends, make memories with friends that are on the other side of the world, 
Simply put, they have played a large part in my life.

Aside from just personal reasons, playing games is also just a great hobby to have. Games are more involved than TV or a movies, and more immersive than books. The greatest power that video games have over other forms of media are that they can *make you feel things.* 
I'm not just talking about that time when I jumped off of a tall building in Assassin's Creed and kinda felt vertigo, I mean real 
emotions. In Resident Evil, I panicked when a zombie that I definitely killed stood back up again. I accomplished a difficult thing when Madeline finally scaled Mount Celeste. My mind was blown when Professor Layton uncovered the mystery behind that thing (he does that in all his games). These are all memories and experiences that I treasure dearly. 

But then, there is one genre of game that trumps all others in my book...
