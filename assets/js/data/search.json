In single-player games, this would include things like maintaining speed in movement-focused games or defeating a difficult boss. When you introduce actual players into the equation however, things start to get a bit more complicated. The goals of the two players are now opposing each other; you still want to let each player do cool things, but now you have to keep in mind that it will come at the expense of the player that is also trying to have a good time.When you’re able to do things to affect another player or the game, it’s generally called interaction. Interaction doesn’t only come into play in just fighting games, but actually a lot of different genres. And, I would say it’s a bit more apparent or prevalent in multiplayer/competative games, but I would argue that it’s present in single-player games as well (but that’s besides the point).Growing up, I enjoyed playing ‘Yu-Gi-Oh’, the trading card game with my friends, but I enjoy it less so now. In modern Yu-Gi-Oh, games can be decided by the initial flip of the coin that decides which player chooses whether to go first or second. A lot of strong decks want to go first so they can set up a powerful board that can stop the opponent from using cards they want, effectively shutting them down and stopping their combos. Personally, I don’t enjoy playing Yu-Gi-Oh as I did before, and I attribute this to the fact that I was unable to interact with my opponents.After playing other card games, specifically “Legends of Runeterra” and “Magic the Gathering”, I’ve found that I enjoy playing these games a lot more. One major difference between these games and Yu-Gi-Oh is that playing cards require a resource, or “Mana” (in both games, funny enough). The amount of mana available grows each turn, meaning that instead of rapid-fast combos that win the game at the start, you play smaller cards at first and gradually build your board, giving each player a chance to interact with each other without immediately overpowering the other. Now, I’m not saying that all decks are equal and will have equal chances to interact with each other, but I feel the structure of the mana-based games naturally leads to more interaction, and I enjoy these games more.The interaction found in fighting games is pretty straightforward. Generally, it’s mostly about doing stuff and the other person reacting to it by doing something else. P1 throws a fireball, P2 can block or jump over it, maybe punish P1 if they do it fast enough. P1 throws an attack, P2 can either block it or avoid it and punish them. P1 grabs, P2 can tech the grab or avoid it and punish them. And in general, all of that is pretty fair on both sides, both parties having opportunities to interact with each other. It’s important to be able to have checks and balances between the different options available to players; making one option too strong makes it generally difficult to interact with, and that becomes a problem.In games where the goals of players are opposing, allowing one player to thrive could potentially lead to neglecting another. If an offense is too oppressive or if it’s too easy to defend against or avoid the other player, the game transitions from two players interacting to one player doing what they want and other player suffering. Ideally, games should make it easier to interact with the other player by making “answers” to “problems” that are presented to you. To help alleviate an oppressive offense, making defensive options available is a great natural way to balance the flow of the game. Street Fighter V has V-Reversals and V-Shifts to help make space or interrupt attacks. Marvel vs. Capcom has push-blocks that create distance if timed correctly. Guilty Gear has Bursts that allow you to escape combos. These are all great defensive options that enable interaction despite getting whaled on by the other player, and they improve the flow of the game. These are also still balanced because it’s possible for other other player to anticipate and play around them and punish these defensive options, maintaining interactability. Also, the stronger options require resources, meaning that they’re not spammable and still allow for interaction on both sides.However, there are cases where it’s ok for interaction to be a bit harder (but not too hard). For example, in most fighting games, heavy characters are generally slower than the rest of the cast, making it harder for them to break defences with their slow attacks, or getting locked down because it’s harder to avoid faster attacks. However, people still play these heavy characters because they usually have special capabilities that make up for the difficutly to get in, either by making it a bit easier to get in or increasing the reward for getting in. They might get unique mechanics like Bowser in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, where light attacks don’t make him flinch, or they could also just deal insane damage, like Potemkin in Guilty Gear. It’d be a problem if these characters were tremendously weaker with little pay off, so it’s important to balance the risk and reward. And of course, if a player is good enough and can predict their opponent’s moves, they can make it really hard to interact with them, but that’s up to the players skill at that point.In the end, the best games are ones that maximize their interactability. One thing that video games have over other media is the ability to directly interact with them. To put it simply, games are fun because you get to do cool things in them. Take away the ability to play, and you might as well be watching a movie." }, { "title": "How Are Characters Balanced?", "url": "/posts/balance_moves/", "categories": "balancing, characters", "tags": "street-fighter", "date": "2022-09-26 06:00:00 -0600", "snippet": "There is a large cast of characters to choose from in fighting games, all with unique moves and mechanics. This diversity leads to a more varied and exciting game experience, and it’s much more interesting to have different characters that do different things with different strengths and weaknesses.However, it’s a struggle to make characters that are fun to use that don’t also completely dominate the rest. Lots of consideration goes into the characters before the game is produced, but play-testing won’t always reveal the flaws of a game, and through the cracks there’d slip something that influences a game, like Meta Knight in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. In the past, nothing could be done to fix stuff like this, and it’d have to be left in the game along with its consequences. However, in the modern age of video games and internet capabilities, it has become common practice to alter games over time in patches, allowing them to live and grow in a sense. In the context of competative games, it’s now possible to stregthen weaker characters and make strong characters… not as strong. Now remember: it’s not bad that a character is good or bad at something. Characters are meant to do cool things in games, or else it’s not fun to play. However, it becomes a problem if a character is good at too many things, especially things that are outside of their intended gameplay. Same goes for weaknesses a character may have; it’s fine if they’re weak at certain things, but it’s bad if they’re not even good at the things they’re meant to be.There are many different ways to alter a character, but let’s focus on one method:Balancing Movesets.There are several major aspects that define a move: Range, Speed, Damage, and Cost The range of a move determines the max distance a character can be from the opponent and still hit them, basically allowing them to control or contest spacing. The speed of a move determines its ability to punish slower moves that whiff or beat out slower moves that are thrown at the same time. The damage of a move determines how much closer you are to winning after you use this move. It doesn’t have to be just this move, but also the combo potential from the move as well, as canceling into stronger moves or combos can lead to even more damage. The cost of a move can mean using resources, like meter or health, but it can also mean punishability, or makeing yourself vulnerable to an attack. Punishability is kinda like speed, but there’s a lot that seperates them. For example, a move could be slow but have a large hurtbox or armor properties that make it hard to punish. Or, a move could be fast but have a lingering hitbox that is easy to take advantage of.These attributes come together to balance the scales of risk and reward. If a move has too much risk or too little reward it’s not even worth using, but too little risk and too much reward and there’s no reason to not throw it out all the time.Let’s look at an example:In Street Fighter V, Cammy is a very strong character with fast moves that hit from far away. One of her moves, “Cannon Strike”, was an aerial dive kick that could quickly hit from accross the screen and combo into other moves, including her high-damaging critical art, all while being extremely hard to punish or react to. The only cost would be that it required a full “V-Meter” which fills by getting hit and doing certain moves. So, looking at the previously mentioned aspects, Cannon Strike had excellent range, speed, and damage, all at a low cost.Their solution was to greatly increase the punish window of a whiffed Cannon Strike from 9 frames to a whopping 17 frames! The move is still incredibly strong, but now with a much higher cost or risk. This was a great fix, as they couldn’t change other aspects of this move, like the speed or the ability to cancel into moves, without severely changing a part of Cammy’s gameplay. Cammy would ultimately play the same, but now with more risk of using this strong move.I can look at more examples in the future, especially an example of making a character better, but this is good for now. It’s a great example of how to make a character more fair (and fun) to play against while not changing a core part of the character’s gameplay. Thanks to balance patches, games can be a better time for everyone. I don’t know how to end this. See ya." }, { "title": "Problems With Fighting Games - Single Player Content", "url": "/posts/fighting_games-prob-2/", "categories": "fighting games, problems", "tags": "general, single-player, street-fighter", "date": "2022-09-17 06:00:00 -0600", "snippet": "Another problem that fighting games have struggled with in the past is a lack of single-player content. The main emphasis of fighting games is usually about fighting versus another person in a competative setting, but it’s also important for games to focus on content that can be enjoyed alone. A fighting game can be a lot of fun, but it can feel like only part of a game if it’s missing single-player action. Whether it’s competative players worn out from the grind of online looking for something else, or people who prefer to play by themselves, it’s important for games to be able to accomodate for that.Street Fighter 5 had a rocky release in February 2016 because of several problems like bad netcode/servers and lack of characters, but especially the lack of single player content. An arcade mode and a story weren’t added to the game until July 2016, 5 months after the initial release! These problems caused the game to be a disappointment in the eyes of many consumers, and although Capcom was eventually able to deliver a quality product by adding the story mode and an arcade mode, the initial reaction of the game had lasting damage that lead to a following smaller than what could potentially have been.Looking at the problems that Street Fighter 5 initially had is incredibly interesting in hindsight, especially because Street Fighter 6 is in development, and it looks like Capcom is determined to not repeat their mistakes. They’ve announced a Single-Player Campaign, where you plays as a customizable character and explore Metro City. They’ve also announced a mode called “Extreme Battle”, a set of rotating game modes with wacky rulesets, like dealing with stage hazards or using a different win condition, perfect for casual enjoyment. Capcom has taken great strides to make Street Fighter 6 a complete product on release, and the content that they’re developing for their fans seems incredibly promising." }, { "title": "Problems With Fighting Games - Intricacy", "url": "/posts/fighting_games-prob-1/", "categories": "fighting games, problems", "tags": "inputs, general", "date": "2022-09-16 08:00:00 -0600", "snippet": "Earlier, I was talking about how fighting games are some of the coolest games out there. However, if that’s the case, why aren’t they more popular? Despite their appeal, fighting games as a genre have some hurdles that put them at a slight disadvantage compared to “normal” games. However, games today are doing better in makingIntricacyIntricacy is something that many fighting game fans appreciate about the genre, but it unfortunately can make fighting games much harder to approach, and less accessible. If a game is too complex or messy, it could make it hard for random onlookers and first-time viewers to follow the action, causing them to lose interest. If it’s taking too long for new players to get good or do something cool, then they’re more likely to drop the game and play something they enjoy. I remember a conversation I was having with an assistant at an optometrist appointment. I was wearing a Street Fighter shirt, and he mentioned that he used to play Injustice. However, he doesn’t play it anymore because he didn’t want to put in the time to do the combos and would rather play games he’d immediately enjoy with what time he had. I might not agree with him, but it’s important to recognize his concerns.Unfortunately, this is also pretty difficult to balance. Make a game too simple and easy and you’ll turn away people that were looking for a challenge, but make it too complex and difficult and casual fans will be less likely to touch the game. There are some approaches that seem to be steps in the right direction, however. Street Fighter 6 announced that it would be implementing “Modern” and “Classic” control schemes, with Modern letting you do certain special moves with a press of a button (with certain less-essential moves unavailable), and Classic keeping the traditional motion inputs. This is actually an incredibly clever way to let newcomers have fun and learn the game sooner while keeping the challenge of grinding and mastery that experienced players seek. Of course, Project L announced a different approach to making these games more accessible, which was simple special inputs. Instead of dp motions or quarter-circle inputs, special moves will be a simple direction and the press of a button. This should also make the game easier for newer players, and it’s not like it lowers the difficulty ceiling by much. Players will still need to master combos and timing to truly play at a higher level. Besides, is there really a benefit to making something unnecessarily difficult if something could be done easily for the same effect?" }, { "title": "Mastering Fighting Games", "url": "/posts/fighting_games/", "categories": "general, personal", "tags": "fighting games, video games", "date": "2022-09-14 20:30:00 -0600", "snippet": "What makes fighting games so special? What makes them different from other games? Why do I like them more than other competative games, like shooters? First off, they’re not the type of game where you complete objectives to directly progress (unless you’re unlocking content by playing, but that’s not exactly the core gameplay…), but you instead progress by getting better at the game. Your progression directly correlates to the skills you develop, the matchups you learn, and the habits you form. You don’t complete the game, you grow and become a better player. I think I can best expound on this by going over the 3 Masteries (I came up with this, unless someone else on the internet said it first I guess…).Mastery of the GameA firm understanding of the game is required to perform well. Of course, that goes without saying, but in what way do you need to understand the game? What comes to mind is mechanics and techniques that are available to you in the game. Knowing complex techniques like wave-dashing or V-Shifting, knowing button inputs for special moves, stuff like that. Sure, you might be able toMastery of SelfHow is this different from Mastery of the Game? Well, you can understand something all you like, but if you’re unable to personally execute any of the techniques or mechanics that you know of, then it’s almost as if you don’t even know them. Players spend countless hours labbing combos and practicing techniques, honing their execution to perfection. By playing or practicing enough, you develop muscle memory, allowing you to focus on other things when you’re playing.This aspect is probably my favorite part of fighting games. After every match–wins, and especially losses–there is always something I can improve on. When I lose, there are usually several things that are extremely apparent to mke that I can do better. Maybe I dropped the game-winning combo, or was letting the other person jump at me for free because I never anti-aired… stuff like that. These mistakes make themselves extremly apparent to me, and I know that if I want to get better at the game, I know what I need to be better at.Mastery of OthersYou don’t just win games by executing combos or playing perfectly, you win games by outplaying your opponent. They too carry the burden of needing to play perfectly, and they share the same consequences for failing to do so. This either happens by capitalizing on mistakes that they make or predicting their actions and decisions. Blocking beats attacking, grabbing beats blocking, attacking beats grabbing (sometimes? unclear sometimes), and it’s up to the players to respond to their opponent correctly. Whiffing attacks gives the other player the opportunity to exploit a brief window of weakness. Expecting the other player to jump in allows you to react faster with an anti-air. Knowing what your opponent is about to do before they do it is a huge advantage over the other player, and correctly exploiting it is a major key to winning.I remember playing with/training my friend who wasn’t very good at Smash Bros. Ultimate; it was especially difficult for him because he was using new controls and wasn’t as familiar with the game as I was. Attacks were almost random, with no real gameplan involved, and jumping/recovering was laborious because he’d have to specifically remember/react to do it. After more playing, he improved tremendously! His attacks and approaches were much more calculated, he could make riskier plays because he understood the game better, jumping/recovering were basically second nature, and he could play with much more ease. He’s come a long way from where he started, and he can give me a hard time in the game now, haha. His journey encapsulates the idea that fighting games require certain proficiencies in order to excel. These requirments are what make fighting games so fun and so freakin cool." }, { "title": "Why Do I Like Video Games?", "url": "/posts/video_games/", "categories": "general, personal", "tags": "video_games", "date": "2022-09-14 06:00:00 -0600", "snippet": "I’ve been playing video games my whole life.

I remember feeling extremely proud of myself after beating Pokemon Fire Red and playing Super Smash Bros. with my friends. Video Games have lead me to meet some of my closest friends, make memories with people on the other side of the world, and so many other great things.Simply put, they have played a large part in my life.Aside from just personal reasons, playing games is also just a great hobby to have. Games are more involved than TV or a movies, and more immersive than books. The greatest power that video games have over other forms of media are that they can make you feel things. I’m not just talking about that time when I jumped off of a tall building in Assassin’s Creed and kinda felt vertigo, I mean real emotions. In Resident Evil, I panicked when a zombie that I definitely killed stood back up again. I accomplished a difficult thing when Madeline finally scaled Mount Celeste. My mind was blown when Professor Layton uncovered the mystery behind that thing (he does that in all his games). These are all memories and experiences that I treasure dearly.But then, there is one genre of game that trumps all others in my book…Fighting games are in a league of their own; there are so many aspects to them that I can’t help but love. The energy they bring, the stories they tell (not just in-game, but through its competitors), the burning passion of its devoted fans, the legacies created by savants and villains, the mastery of the game, the mastery over others, the mastery over yourself… is beyond anything else I’ve ever seen.
